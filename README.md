This is a quick and simple article/repository on how to install forge mods into Minecraft: Java Edition


Before we start installing our Youtuber's favorite Minecraft mods or the viruses that your friends sent you on Discord. You are going to Need Java. In order to run your Minecraft mod loader client. 

First, we are going to need to install Java

*Click on x64 or x86 depending on your computer's OS (open windows and search "System Information" It will tell you if you have x32 or x64)*

Second, we are going to need out favorite Minecraft mod loader Forge: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.18.2.html

*Recommended ensures full compatibility (1.18.2 is the version I'm downloading for my Minecraft "AllTheThingsMod")*

Third, since we've installed Java on our computers. We need double click (or run) our Minecraft forge loader you've just downloaded.

*Make sure that Java(TM) Platform SE Binary is selected and click Always or Just Once*


Fourth, The Forge client windows should pop up and click on "Install Client" Then click, "OK". It should install properly if you have a license to own the game.

Fifth, if you have Minecraft Launcher open while this is downloading, just restart your launcher. 


Sixth, Reopen your Minecraft Launcher and click on the modded version that is installed on Minecraft Launcher.

*Make sure this tab is checked under "Installations Tab"*

Seventh, launch the modded version, it should look like the Forge icon with whatever version you've chose to install. 
*This will create the proper folders you will need to place your mods in*

Eigth, navigate to your Roaming Appdata folder in File Explorer. 


*You may need to show hidden folders*

Place any .JAR file you want in the, "mods" folder. 

                            HORRAY!! YOU HAVE DONE IT!


    Additional notes; 

    1. Some mods you download off the internet may need a specific version of the Forge loader

    2. Some mods you download may need a different version of Minecraft to function properly (The mod's description or version list will mostly tell you)

    3. Don't download Minecraft hacks or mods from people you don't trust. They are just trying to steal your Minecraft account

    4. Please don't download a free version of Minecraft
